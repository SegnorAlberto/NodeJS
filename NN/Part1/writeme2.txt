Female genital mutilation (FGM) refers to “all procedures involving
partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other
injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.”[1] FGM
is a violation of girls’ and women’s human rights. While the exact number
of girls and women worldwide who have undergone FGM remains unknown, at
least 200 million girls and women have been cut in 30 countries with
representative data on prevalence. However, the majority of girls and women
in most countries with available data think FGM should end and there has
been an overall decline in the prevalence of the practice over the last
three decades, but not all countries have made progress and the pace of
decline has been uneven.
